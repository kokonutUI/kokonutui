## Getting Started

KokonutUI components are meant to be use with Next.js projects that use TailwindCSS and shadcn. However they are also compatible with any React Project.

### Using Shadcn CLI.

All components can be installed using [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli), which make it really easy.

```bash
# npx, bunx...
bunx shadcn@latest add https://kokonut.dev/registry/ai-input-01.json
```

```jsx
import AIInput_01 from "@/components/ui/ai-input-01";

export function AIInput01Demo() {
    return <AIInput_01 />;
}
```

### Manual installation

-   **Copy and Paste**: Select and copy the component code you want to use.

-   **Check Requirements**: Some components need additional libraries (e.g., Framer Motion, Lucide React). Required libraries are listed at the top-right corner of each component.
-   **Customize as Needed**: Modify styles and animations to match your projectâ€™s look and feel or simply use the default one.
